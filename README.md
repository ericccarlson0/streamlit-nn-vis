# streamlit-nn-vis
A project to visualize basic statistics related to networks. For the most part, the purpose here is to help with sanity checking and monitoring progress -- nothing too crazy. A lot of good, free visualization software exists out there (Altair, seaborn, matplotlib, and more), so getting around unnecessary work by implementing these will be important.

**NOTE**: This project is just getting started.
